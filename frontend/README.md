# Installation of the Frontend

Navigate to the `./frontend` folder and setup the `.env` file:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
FIREWORKS_API_KEY=
```
# Executing the Frontend without docker (optional)

Still on the `./frontend` folder, install the Node modules by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

Lastly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once you have done everything, we can move on to the next part:
- [Executing the demo with docker](../) (not necessary if it was already done without docker )
- Or go back [to the main page](../)
